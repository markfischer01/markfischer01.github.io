      <description>Man is it tough being a Broncos fan. Since Peyton Manning left after winning the Super Bowl in the 2015-2016 season, the Broncos have started 11 different QBâ€™s with a combined record of 39-58. I also struggle to mention the fact of 14-straight losses to the repulsive team in Kansas City. The Broncos are a storied franchise with multiple Super Bowl wins and is home to many great players, so something has to fall in their favor, right?</description>
